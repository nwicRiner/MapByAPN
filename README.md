# MapByAPN
create geodatabase of parcels matching APN#'s in ICDB

This is the entire python script for a tool to run in an ArcMap that contains layers of parcel shapes.
The tool in ArcMap is setup to accept 1 input parameter, which is the filename of the saved selections file that is generated by the ICDB.
this tool uses the list of reports or resources in the saved selections file,
finds the address record(s) for each entry,
obtains the string value in the APN field from the tblResourceAddr (for Resources) or tblInventoryAddr (for Reports),
and searches for the APN values in the parcel layer in the current map document.
For every matching APN value found, it copies that parcel feature to an initialized shapefile (.shp)
It then fills out attributes for that feature that match the schema of the correponsding Resources or Reports layers
in the IC geodatabase.
Thus the resulting features in the output shape file are suitable for pasting into the appropriate layer in the IC GIS
- Resources: copying OtherID=ResourceName, PrimCo/PrimNo (primary number), any trinomial, setting DocSource=parcel, DigSource=parcel, DigBy=<currentUser>, DigDate=<currentDate>
- Reports: copying OtherID=report title, DocCO/DocNo, DocSource=parcel, DigSource=parcel, DigBy=<currentUser>, DigDate=<currentDate>
